function echoes = findEchoes(seq,om_store)
%echoes = FINDECHOES(seq,om_store)
% Finds echo timings and intensities given sequence seq and 
% om_store (the later being generated by EPG_custom.m)
% 
% We only find the proper and unique echoes
% Criteria: 
% (a) The F(0) component must be non-zero (>5*eps)
% (b) If there are multiple echoes satisfying (a) at the same timing,
%     use the last value. So for grad->relax->RF, we only get F(0) after
%     the RF, and for grad->relax, we only get F(0) after the relaxation.
% 
% output: echoes is N x 2 matrix where N is the number of echoes found
%         1st col - timing; 2nd col - intensity (modulus of F(0))
