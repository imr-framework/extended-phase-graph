% Generates EPG for the hyperecho pulse sequence, a sensitive test for
% the accuracy of the EPG framework. With an initial 90 pulse and 
% a midway 180 pulse, the hyperecho sequence mirror the phase, flip
% angle, and timing of the first half in the second half to generate a
% perfect echo (if relaxation is neglected) at the end of the sequence.
%
% 
% INPUTS
%       rf - 2 x N matrix representing N arbitrary RF pulses
%            which are reversed for the second half of the sequence
%       esp - spacing between RF pulses
%       rlx - relaxation ([T1,T2]; set to [0,0] for no relxation)
% alphas : length m array of flip angles.
% TR: spacing between RF pulses
% rlx: mode of relaxation. Default : no relaxation
